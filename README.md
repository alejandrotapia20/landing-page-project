# landing-page-project

I'm writing this as a reflection to this simple project. It took me a few hours to finish. The best part was seeing how all the sections came up together and once I had the finished product I couldn't believe I actually built my first website. I learnt a lot but still have a lot more to learn, especially flexbox.
